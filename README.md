# English to Telugu Neural Machine Translation

This repository contains a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model that translates English sentences to Telugu. The NMT model leverages deep learning techniques to perform this task effectively.

## Model Details

- **Model Type**: Seq2Seq with Attention Mechanism
- **Training Data**: English-Telugu parallel corpus
- **Framework**: PyTorch

## Usage

### Viewing the Notebook

You can view the Jupyter Notebook that contains the code and explanation of the NMT model by clicking the following link:

[English to Telugu NMT Notebook](https://github.com/Asrivast1/english_telugu_nmt/blob/main/English_Telugu_NMT.ipynb)

### Running the Model

To run the NMT model, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Asrivast1/english_telugu_nmt.git

2. Install Jupyter Notebook if you haven't already:

   ```bash
   pip install jupyter

3. Navigate to the cloned repository:

   ```bash
   cd english_telugu_nmt

4. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook

5. In your web browser, a new tab will open with the Jupyter Notebook interface. Locate and open the ***English_Telugu_NMT.ipynb*** notebook.

6. Follow the instructions within the notebook to run and experiment with the NMT model.

### Requirements

The notebook uses various Python libraries and dependencies. You can find the list of required libraries and their versions in the notebook itself.
